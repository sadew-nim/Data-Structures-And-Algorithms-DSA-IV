## 📌 Algorithms Included

### 1️⃣ Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic **recursive problem** that follows the **Divide and Conquer** approach.

**Key Points:**
- Uses recursion
- Moves disks from source rod to destination rod using an auxiliary rod
- Follows strict rules (one disk at a time, smaller on larger)

**Time Complexity:**  
- **O(2ⁿ)**

---

### 2️⃣ Bubble Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Key Points:**
- Simple and easy to implement
- Not efficient for large datasets

**Time Complexity:**  
- **Best Case:** O(n²)  
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)

---

### 3️⃣ Optimized Bubble Sort Algorithm
An improved version of Bubble Sort that stops execution early if the array becomes sorted.

**Key Points:**
- Uses a `swapped` flag
- Reduces unnecessary passes
- Efficient for already sorted arrays

**Time Complexity:**  
- **Best Case:** O(n)  
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)

---

### 4️⃣ Insertion Sort Algorithm
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by placing each element in its correct position.

**Key Points:**
- Efficient for small datasets
- Works well for nearly sorted arrays

**Time Complexity:**  
- **Best Case:** O(n)  
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)
